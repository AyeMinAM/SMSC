The Society is incorporated under the Society Act in British Columbia and holds registered not-for-profit charity status through the Canada Revenue Agency.</p>
    
            
        <p class="text-justify">

        The purpose of the Society is to practice and discuss Theravada Buddhism with serious practitioners and to promote and provide education to anyone interested in exploring Theravada Buddhism. The Society&apos;s approach is built around Satipatthana Vipassana (Pure Vipassana) meditation, which is commonly known in the West as Insight Through Mindfulness meditation. The Society offers classes, sitting meditation, monthly residential retreats as the various formats of communication available to interested parties.

                    <p class="text-justify">The satipatthana vipassana meditation that the Society adheres to is directly based on the Four Foundations of Mindfulness taught by the Buddha in the Satipatthana Discourse. The late Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw of Myanmar popularized this tradition in 1960&apos;s and 70&apos;s to the world outside of Myanmar. The practice is the pure Vipassana method, rather than the mixed (Samatha-Vipassana) method. Even those with no previous meditation experience can experience results in a relatively short period of time if they are earnest and hard working. Mahasi Sayadaw&apos;s chief disciples, the Venerable Sayadaws U Khundala, U Pandita, the late U Silananda and U Janaka continued to spread this technique throughout the world from the 1980&apos;s to the present time.

                    Generosity, morality, mindfulness, concentration and intuitive understanding are the main pillars of the practice. The SMSC welcomes people of all faiths and ethnic backgrounds. A genuine belief in the necessity for loving kindness and compassion in the world is the only prerequisite required.
