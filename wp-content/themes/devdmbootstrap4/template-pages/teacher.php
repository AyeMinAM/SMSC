                Sayalay Nana Malini was born in Bangkor Island Indonesia.  Sayalay’s birth name as a lay person was Jennifer Chew.  She was ordained at Chanmyay Yeiktha, Yangon, Myanmar.  Sayalay’s preceptor monk was Sayadaw U Janaka Bhivamsa.
                Sayalay participated in her first group meditation in 2001, in Indonesia.  In 2002, she participated annually in meditation groups in Myanmar.  The first one was a week long, and the longest was one year in duration.  Ten years later her honourable teacher U Janaka Bhivamsa told Sayalay Nana Malini that she would receive even more benefits if she could share her knowledge of Vipassana with those who wish to be free from suffering.  Sayalay accepted her honourable teacher’s words, and started teaching meditation in Indonesia, Macao, Hong Kong and Canada.
